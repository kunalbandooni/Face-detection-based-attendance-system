# Face-Detection-Based-Attendance-System
___
## 1.0 About Project : 

- This project was made in order to save time while taking attendance.
- It may look too-much for a small class, but in a large class, the project would do a great job.
- It is really simple to use, we just have to put the student's image in the folder "IMAGE" along with the image name set as the student's name.
- Type "python app.py" to start the flask locally.
- The code will do 128 dimension encoding of each image.
- Each face has special features of it's own, so 128 unique features are encoded and then compared for marking attendance.
- Open the link and port given in terminal, and in a few seconds (time depends on the dataset), the camera will open and mark attendance accordingly.

## 2.0 Requirements for the Project:

- ### 2.1 Hardware Requirements:
