# Face-Detection-Based-Attendance-System
___
## 1.0 About Project : 

- This project was made in order to save time while taking attendance.
- It may look too-much for a small class, but in a large class, the project would do a great job.
- It is really simple to use, we just have to put student's image in the folder "IMAGE" along with image name set as student's name.
- Type "pyhton app.py" to start the flask locally.
- Open the link and port given in terminal, and in a few seconds (time depends on dataset), the camera will open and mark attendance accordingly.

## 2.0 Requirements for the Project:

- ### 2.1 Hardware Requirements:
    - (Not done so far) - Tried unsuccessfully in Raspberry-Pi
